This folder is intended to contain files that will only be stored on pearl (eAtlas data repository). This includes raw video files for YouTube tutorials and raw lossless compressed versions of the satellite imagery. These files are not made publicly because they are large and are available in far more accessible formats (YouTube and JPEG compressed versions of the imagery).

Separating these large files (that almost no one will need again) helps ensure that the data package representing the dataset is far easier to download and use.

If for some reason you would like access to the raw satellite imagery (which you can regenerate from GEE) or the raw video files then please contact Eric Lawrey (e.lawrey@aims.gov.au).
