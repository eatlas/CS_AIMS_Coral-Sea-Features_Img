This folder is intended to contain files that will only be stored on pearl (eAtlas data repository). This includes raw video files for YouTube tutorials. These files are not made publicly because they are large and are available in far more accessible formats (YouTube).

Separating these large files (that almost no one will need again) helps ensure that the data package representing the dataset is far easier to download and use.
