# Input folder Google Earth Engine Images

Images generated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) are exported to Google Drive.

These files should then be downloaded to this folder for processing using the
`src\02-local\convert.py` script. This will optimise the GeoTiffs and setup
Virtal Raster files for each region / colour grade combination making it easier
to manipulate the imagery in QGIS.

Once the imagery has been processed (which will create output images in `data`)
the image files in this folder can be deleted to save space.

The downloaded images should be organised by satellite (`S2` or `L8`) and region 
(`Coral-Sea` or `Global`) into folders `S2\Coral-Sea`, `S2\Global`, `L8\Coral-Sea` 
and `L8\Global` folders. The processing organises the final data using the same 
regional folders as the `unprocessed-data`.
